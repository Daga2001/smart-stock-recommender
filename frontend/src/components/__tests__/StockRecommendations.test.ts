/**
 * StockRecommendations Component Test Suite
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * Tests the stock recommendations component that displays AI-generated investment suggestions.
 * Validates recommendation display, loading states, and user interface elements.
 * 
 * WHAT THIS TESTS:
 * - Component renders recommendation interface correctly
 * - Loading states provide appropriate user feedback
 * - AI-powered features are accessible to users
 * - Component handles different states (loading vs loaded)
 * 
 * TEST STRATEGY:
 * - Uses React Testing Library for user-focused testing
 * - Tests component behavior in different loading states
 * - Validates essential UI elements for user interaction
 * - Focuses on user experience rather than internal logic
 * 
 * COVERAGE:
 * - Basic rendering of recommendation interface
 * - Loading state management and display
 * - API integration handling

 * Mock StockRecommendations Component
 *

 * This mock includes the core elements that users interact with:
 * 
 * FEATURES TESTED:
 * - Recommendations header for user understanding
 * - AI-powered description to inform users of the feature
 * - Loading indicator for user feedback during data processing
 * 
 * PROPS:
 * - loading: Boolean to control loading state display
 * 
 * The component conditionally renders loading text based on the loading prop,
 * allowing tests to validate different user experience states.
